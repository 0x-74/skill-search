Work-life balance
Keeping connected in a hybrid virtual-first environment We come to work each day, whether at the office or at home, to serve our clients, both internal and external, and to connect with colleagues. Gartner operates under a hybrid virtual-first working arrangement, which is perfectly suited to our digital business, as the majority of our products and services are digital. This purposeful strategy allows flexibility while fostering connection and collaboration: Most associates can work remotely the majority of the time and have the ability to use our world-class offices for team meetings, other forms of in-person collaboration and uninterrupted focus. Our approach is suited to meet the needs and expectations of a changing workforce. Moreover, it allows associates to join forces and collaborate on a global scale, eliminating the boundaries of physical distance. To ensure that everybody remains connected, we have invested in collaboration technologies and have brought associates together through in-person team meetings, ERG learning opportunities and events and other collaboration opportunities at the office.

Zorba is the new age analytics provider that brings data driven decision to life for its clients. We believe in getting analytics executed on ground with the client team rather than just creating complex machine learning or predictive modelling algorithms.

We offer services across the spectrum ranging from analytics training and setting up data centres to delivering analytics based strategic consulting solutions. One of the key value adds we do is with the speed at which we deliver solutions.

Headquartered in Mumbai, Zorba was conceived with an objective of creating value for businesses in near future rather than long term.

About AiDASH

AiDASH is making critical infrastructure industries climate-resilient and sustainable with satellites and AI. Using our full-stack SaaS solutions, customers in electric, gas, water utilities, transportation, and construction are transforming asset inspection and maintenance - and complying with biodiversity net gain mandates and carbon capture goals. AiDASH exists to safeguard critical infrastructure and secure the future of humanAIty™. Learn more at www.aidash.com

We are a Series C climate tech startup backed by leading investors, including Shell Ventures, National Grid Partners, G2 Venture Partners, Duke Energy, Edison International, Lightrock, Marubeni, among others. We have been recognized by Forbes two years in a row as one of “America’s Best Startup Employers.” We are also proud to be one of the few climate software companies in Time Magazine’s “America’s Top GreenTech Companies 2024”. Deloitte Technology Fast 500™ recently ranked us at No. 12 among San Francisco Bay Area companies, and No. 59 overall in their selection of the top 500 for 2024.

Join us in Securing Tomorrow!

The Role

Our customers rely on AiDASH to keep the power on, protect biodiversity, and safeguard lives and livelihoods. When they raise an issue, it’s not a “ticket”—it’s a risk to their operations and reputation. That’s where you come in.

As our first dedicated Lead Customer Support Engineer, you will lead the function that ensures customer issues are rapidly diagnosed, routed, and resolved, while also surfacing patterns, driving systemic fixes, and shaping how we scale support across our global business. This is a hands-on, high-stakes role. You’re not here to run a help desk. You’re here to lead the nerve centre of our customer response.

How you'll make an impact:

Resolve escalated issues end-to-end 
Lead the L2 function and act as the primary L2 escalation point for complex or unresolved technical issues from the L1 team 
Own high-priority L2 tickets from triage to closure, ensuring deep technical troubleshooting, clear communication, and timely resolution. 
Be hands-on: analyze logs, replicate issues, debug root causes, and implement short-term or permanent fixes independently. 
Coordinate cross-functionally to unblock 
Collaborate with Product, Engineering, and Customer Success to drive resolution of complex technical issues requiring multi-team effort. 
Escalate and follow through on dependencies outside the support team's direct control. 
Drive operational excellence 
Build and maintain structured support workflows—including ticket prioritization, escalation paths, documentation, and handoffs. 
Implement and optimize support tools (e.g., Jira, Zendesk) to track status, measure performance, and ensure visibility. 
Identify patterns and improve systems 
Analyze support trends to distinguish recurring issues from outliers; uncover root causes and recommend product or process changes. 
Maintain a backlog of systemic issues and partner with relevant teams to drive long-term resolution. 
Represent the customer internally 
Act as the voice of the customer in post-incident reviews, product discussions, and planning cycles, using insights from real support cases. 
Advocate for product reliability, usability, and supportability based on lived customer challenges. 
Deliver concise and actional executive reporting on key metrics –ticket volumes, MTTR, FRT, CSAT, customer pain-points/escalation patterns, system health 
Own SLAs, but don’t be bound by them: Do what it takes to keep our field users working, even when that means working odd hours or chasing down the right owner across time zones 


What we're looking for:

A hands-on technical leader with 5–7 years in SaaS support, solutions engineering, or technical account management, including hands-on debugging and escalation management 
Experienced in coordinating cross-functional issue resolution—you know how to get things fixed even when you don’t own the code. 
Comfortable managing the day-to-day firefighting while keeping an eye on strategic support improvements. 
Able to think analytically and act operationally—whether triaging a ticket or preparing a quarterly support trends deck. 
Excellent communicator: You tailor your message for customers, engineers, or execs—with clarity, confidence, and precision 
Tool-savvy: Comfortable using and configuring tools like Jira, Zendesk, Amplitude, Confluence, etc. 


What you'll love: 

A mission that matters—your work protects critical infrastructure and lives. 
A global team of the best and brightest across AI, product, field ops, and science. 
A seat at the table to shape how AiDASH scales its support model and customer experience. 
A fast-moving, respectful culture where outcomes speak louder than org charts


We are proud to be an equal-opportunity employer. We are committed to embracing diversity and inclusion in our hiring practices, and we promote a work environment where everyone, from any race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin, can do their best work.

We are committed to providing an inclusive and accessible interview experience for all candidates. Please let us know if you require any accommodation during the interview process, and we will make every effort to meet your needs.

Every associate is encouraged to create an individual development plan, which includes career interests and areas of strengths and development needs. Connecting their work to Gartner’s business goals helps our associates develop engagement and purpose. We see it as a core success factor that enabled over 4,700 of our associates — or over 24% of our workforce — to earn promotions in 2022.

Work-life balance
Keeping connected in a hybrid virtual-first environment We come to work each day, whether at the office or at home, to serve our clients, both internal and external, and to connect with colleagues. Gartner operates under a hybrid virtual-first working arrangement, which is perfectly suited to our digital business, as the majority of our products and services are digital. This purposeful strategy allows flexibility while fostering connection and collaboration: Most associates can work remotely the majority of the time and have the ability to use our world-class offices for team meetings, other forms of in-person collaboration and uninterrupted focus. Our approach is suited to meet the needs and expectations of a changing workforce. Moreover, it allows associates to join forces and collaborate on a global scale, eliminating the boundaries of physical distance.

Keeping connected in a hybrid virtual-first environment We come to work each day, whether at the office or at home, to serve our clients, both internal and external, and to connect with colleagues.

This purposeful strategy allows flexibility while fostering connection and collaboration: Most associates can work remotely the majority of the time and have the ability to use our world-class offices for team meetings, other forms of in-person collaboration and uninterrupted focus. Our approach is suited to meet the needs and expectations of a changing workforce.

Career growth and learning
Talent development is foundational to driving associate engagement and essential to Gartner’s continued market leadership. As our ability to grow and adapt as an organization requires that we help our associates reach their full potential, continuous improvement is key to our talent development strategy. Through ongoing feedback and goal setting, we help our associates understand their top priorities and how those priorities result in value for Gartner clients. Every associate is encouraged to create an individual development plan, which includes career interests and areas of strengths and development needs. Connecting their work to Gartner’s business goals helps our associates develop engagement and purpose. We see it as a core success factor that enabled over 4,700 of our associates — or over 24% of our workforce — to earn promotions in 2022.

Work-life balance
Keeping connected in a hybrid virtual-first environment We come to work each day, whether at the office or at home, to serve our clients, both internal and external, and to connect with colleagues. Gartner operates under a hybrid virtual-first working arrangement, which is perfectly suited to our digital business, as the majority of our products and services are digital. This purposeful strategy allows flexibility while fostering connection and collaboration: Most associates can work remotely the majority of the time and have the ability to use our world-class offices for team meetings, other forms of in-person collaboration and uninterrupted focus. Our approach is suited to meet the needs and expectations of a changing workforce. Moreover, it allows associates to join forces and collaborate on a global scale, eliminating the boundaries of physical distance. To ensure that everybody remains connected, we have invested in collaboration technologies and have brought associates together through in-person team meetings, ERG learning opportunities and events and other collaboration opportunities at the office.

Designation: DevOps Engineer II

Participate in on-call rotations for incident response and resolution. 

Required Skills

Must-have:

At least 5 years of experience as a DevOps Engineer. 
Deep understanding of production infrastructure: how to prevent failures, manage changes, and ensure seamless operation of services. 
Terraform (critical skill) – strong experience in writing, understanding, and reviewing existing code. 
Experience managing Kubernetes (EKS) and ECS clusters in AWS. 
Expertise in AWS services (EC2, S3, IAM, RDS, Lambda, VPC). 
Experience with CI/CD tools (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Jenkins). 
Strong knowledge of monitoring and logging tools (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenSearch/ELK). 
Solid understanding of Linux and networking concepts. 
Ability to write scripts and read existing code in Python and Bash. 
Experience building highly available and scalable systems. 

Nice-to-have:

Experience optimizing cloud resource costs (FinOps approach). 
Experience with serverless architectures (AWS Lambda, API Gateway). 
Experience working with databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Aerospike). 
Knowledge of log analysis and monitoring tools in distributed systems. 
Experience working in an Agile/Scrum environment. 

What We Seek In a Candidate

Engineering mindset – not just fixing issues but understanding their root causes and preventing them. 
Proactiveness – identifying areas for improvement and proposing solutions.

BONUS: 


Experience with distributed training, working with healthcare datasets, or deploying models in production environments.


Benefits

Work at the cutting edge of AI and be a part of a mission-driven team transforming healthcare

This purposeful strategy allows flexibility while fostering connection and collaboration: Most associates can work remotely the majority of the time and have the ability to use our world-class offices for team meetings, other forms of in-person collaboration and uninterrupted focus. Our approach is suited to meet the needs and expectations of a changing workforce.

Environmental sustainability
NVIDIA’s technological leaps in accelerated computing and generative AI are at the heart of a new industrial revolution, fundamentally reshaping industries by enhancing computing power and significantly advancing sustainability. By accelerating workloads with NVIDIA GPUs operating in parallel, we exponentially increase throughput while driving down the total energy used to complete a task and, thus, the total cost of ownership. Accelerated computing took workloads that previously required tens of thousands of general-purpose servers, consuming 10X to 20X more cost and energy and compressed it into something incredibly dense. NVIDIA’s AI technologies can transform climate research and help the world mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. In addition to powering climate and weather simulations, AI is accelerating the energy transition by making industrial-scale renewable energy more efficient and economically viable. AI can also optimize solar and wind farms, enhance power grid reliability and resilience, advance carbon capture, and power fusion breakthroughs.

About the job
About the Role:

We are looking for a Python Engineer to help us take our data visualization products (see examples here and here!) through the following several enhancements. The role will be responsible for creating and improving front-end visualizations, understanding what the data means, and contributing to designing, building, and improving the data pipelines that feed those products.

We use Dash/Plotly for data visualization on our customer-facing products. Dash is a very powerful platform that is quickly developing, and we want to keep up with what's possible and make the best use of it!

Understanding the domain (new visualizations and features) is also critical!

Visualizations:

Help the rest of the data science team productize features by developing a UI that presents the data and recommendations and lets customers play around.

Build and enhance internal and customer-facing dashboards to track metrics and trends that help customers use PriceLabs more effectively.


Data & Infrastructure:

Maintain and improve the framework that helps us embed the Dash/Plotly visualizations into our product.
Help us speed up the visualization products by improving the backend code (e.g., more efficient code or implementing systems to cache data) 


About You:

Strong understanding of data visualization principles, algorithms, and data structures.
At least 3 years of programming experience in Python. Familiarity and experience with Dash/Plotly are a big plus!
Experience in front-end web technologies (CSS, HTML, bootstrap, etc.)
Strong communication skills, including the ability and willingness to explain complicated ideas in simple terms.
Experience with relational databases and strong knowledge of SQL.
Prior experience working in a fast-paced environment.
Desire to wear many hats.


Preferred:

Experience writing product code at a SaaS company

About the job
Imagine a role where you're not just maintaining the status quo but revolutionizing it. As a seasoned DevOps engineer, you’ll dive into the heart of legacy systems, transforming them into efficient, automated infrastructures. We’re searching for an AWS maestro who thrives in environments demanding 99.9% uptime, where each acquired product presents a unique puzzle. Your challenge? To migrate these diverse systems into a unified, scalable AWS architecture, complete with robust monitoring and automation that minimizes incidents.

While many roles focus on a single stack, we offer the opportunity to harmonize multiple stacks, enhancing efficiency without causing disruption. Instead of isolating databases, you'll strategically consolidate them to maximize cost-effectiveness and management efficiency across our portfolio. This isn’t a position for those content with routine maintenance; it’s for innovators eager to transform chaos into order.

From infrastructure migrations to AI-powered automation, performance tuning, and cost optimization, you'll oversee it all. You'll diagnose issues, orchestrate seamless cloud migrations with minimal downtime, and employ AI/ML to automate significant portions of your responsibilities. With the power to make critical infrastructure decisions, you won’t be bogged down by endless approvals.

If you relish the challenge of untangling complex systems and ensuring they operate seamlessly, this role is your ideal playground. However, if you require constant guidance, struggle with multiple tech stacks, or prefer starting from scratch rather than optimizing existing systems, this might not be the fit for you. If you're ready to take charge of a high-impact infrastructure role with ample scope for building, optimizing, and automating at scale, we invite you to apply!

What You Will Be Doing

Leading intricate infrastructure transitions, including moving from legacy systems to AWS cloud environments and lift-and-shift migrations.
Crafting and executing monitoring strategies and developing automations for system monitoring, software deployments, and operational workflows.
Engaging in system monitoring, backups, incident management, database migrations, configurations, and cost optimization.

What You Won’t Be Doing

Spending your days in Jira or endless status meetings – we value proactive solution drivers over problem trackers.
Being stuck maintaining outdated systems – you'll be empowered to initiate significant improvements.
Waiting on bureaucratic approval chains – you'll have the autonomy to implement immediate solutions for incidents.
Confining yourself to narrow technical silos – this role demands both broad and deep expertise.
Struggling for budget to enact vital improvements – we recognize the importance of investing in infrastructure.

Senior DevOps Engineer Key Responsibilities

Enhance the reliability and standardization of our cloud infrastructure across a growing product range by implementing effective monitoring, automation, and AWS best practices.

Basic Requirements

Extensive AWS infrastructure knowledge (this is our main platform – experience with other clouds isn't sufficient).
Proficient programming in Python or JavaScript for automation and tooling development.
Experience in managing and migrating production databases with various engines (including MySql, Postgres, Oracle, MS-SQL).
Advanced skills in Docker/Kubernetes.
Experience with infrastructure automation tools (Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation).
Expertise in Linux systems administration.

About the job
In most companies, traditional customer support is often plagued by inefficiency and mediocrity. Support engineers frequently waste time on repetitive tasks or struggle with problems outside their narrow expertise. Data shows that over 60% of tickets get escalated because the first line of defense lacks the skills or knowledge to resolve them.

At Trilogy, we don't do traditional. Managing over 100 enterprise software products, we've redefined customer support with advanced AI. Most issues are handled by our AI-powered chatbot, leaving only the most complex challenges for our engineers. That means every ticket you touch is difficult, varied, and requires creative problem-solving.

In this role, there's no time for hand-holding or "learning the ropes" at a leisurely pace. If you need constant guidance, struggle to self-learn, or tend to ask obvious questions, you won't last two weeks. Success requires a proactive mindset, the ability to adapt quickly, and the drive to figure things out independently.

If you're ready to step up and tackle the toughest problems in customer support, this role will accelerate your growth like nothing else. You'll gain unparalleled technical expertise across a massive product portfolio while contributing directly to Trilogy's reputation for excellence. If you are up to the task of pushing your limits, we'd love to see you apply.

What You Will Be Doing

AI-Augmented Customer Resolutions: Analyze complex tickets escalated by AI systems, apply human expertise to areas where AI falls short, and then close the gap by improving the AI system

What You Won’t Be Doing

Taking two whole months to get up to speed; you will be expected to ramp up one several products within the first month (we are aware this is aggressive)
Relying on your managers for help; if you are not adept at unblocking yourself, you will likely struggle in this role

Application Support Engineer Key Responsibilities

Integrate technical human expertise and AI capabilities to deliver exceptional customer support, focusing on complex issues that AI cannot yet fully resolve

Basic Requirements

Lead design and execution of cross-cutting initiatives to improve reliability, latency, and throughput across time-sensitive APIs and workflows
Work hands-on with technologies like NestJS, PostgreSQL, Firestore, MongoDB, Redis, GCP Pub/Sub, and Istio-based microservices
Drive observability and resilience by evolving our monitoring, alerting (Prometheus/Grafana), and incident response strategies
Partner with product, infra, and security teams to ensure data integrity, access control, and compliance across calendar data
Mentor and guide a team of high-performing engineers, encouraging technical excellence and career growth
Participate in design reviews, deep dives, and on-call rotations to support a high-bar culture of accountability and operational excellence

Requirements:

Familiarity with monitoring, SLOs, and root-cause analysis in production environments
Excellent communication and cross-functional collaboration skills
A pragmatic, hands-on leader who balances long-term vision with iterative execution
