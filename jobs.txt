Work-life balance
Keeping connected in a hybrid virtual-first environment We come to work each day, whether at the office or at home, to serve our clients, both internal and external, and to connect with colleagues. Gartner operates under a hybrid virtual-first working arrangement, which is perfectly suited to our digital business, as the majority of our products and services are digital. This purposeful strategy allows flexibility while fostering connection and collaboration: Most associates can work remotely the majority of the time and have the ability to use our world-class offices for team meetings, other forms of in-person collaboration and uninterrupted focus. Our approach is suited to meet the needs and expectations of a changing workforce. Moreover, it allows associates to join forces and collaborate on a global scale, eliminating the boundaries of physical distance. To ensure that everybody remains connected, we have invested in collaboration technologies and have brought associates together through in-person team meetings, ERG learning opportunities and events and other collaboration opportunities at the office.

Zorba is the new age analytics provider that brings data driven decision to life for its clients. We believe in getting analytics executed on ground with the client team rather than just creating complex machine learning or predictive modelling algorithms.

We offer services across the spectrum ranging from analytics training and setting up data centres to delivering analytics based strategic consulting solutions. One of the key value adds we do is with the speed at which we deliver solutions.

Headquartered in Mumbai, Zorba was conceived with an objective of creating value for businesses in near future rather than long term.

About AiDASH

AiDASH is making critical infrastructure industries climate-resilient and sustainable with satellites and AI. Using our full-stack SaaS solutions, customers in electric, gas, water utilities, transportation, and construction are transforming asset inspection and maintenance - and complying with biodiversity net gain mandates and carbon capture goals. AiDASH exists to safeguard critical infrastructure and secure the future of humanAIty™. Learn more at www.aidash.com

We are a Series C climate tech startup backed by leading investors, including Shell Ventures, National Grid Partners, G2 Venture Partners, Duke Energy, Edison International, Lightrock, Marubeni, among others. We have been recognized by Forbes two years in a row as one of “America’s Best Startup Employers.” We are also proud to be one of the few climate software companies in Time Magazine’s “America’s Top GreenTech Companies 2024”. Deloitte Technology Fast 500™ recently ranked us at No. 12 among San Francisco Bay Area companies, and No. 59 overall in their selection of the top 500 for 2024.

Join us in Securing Tomorrow!

The Role

Our customers rely on AiDASH to keep the power on, protect biodiversity, and safeguard lives and livelihoods. When they raise an issue, it’s not a “ticket”—it’s a risk to their operations and reputation. That’s where you come in.

As our first dedicated Lead Customer Support Engineer, you will lead the function that ensures customer issues are rapidly diagnosed, routed, and resolved, while also surfacing patterns, driving systemic fixes, and shaping how we scale support across our global business. This is a hands-on, high-stakes role. You’re not here to run a help desk. You’re here to lead the nerve centre of our customer response.

How you'll make an impact:

Resolve escalated issues end-to-end 
Lead the L2 function and act as the primary L2 escalation point for complex or unresolved technical issues from the L1 team 
Own high-priority L2 tickets from triage to closure, ensuring deep technical troubleshooting, clear communication, and timely resolution. 
Be hands-on: analyze logs, replicate issues, debug root causes, and implement short-term or permanent fixes independently. 
Coordinate cross-functionally to unblock 
Collaborate with Product, Engineering, and Customer Success to drive resolution of complex technical issues requiring multi-team effort. 
Escalate and follow through on dependencies outside the support team's direct control. 
Drive operational excellence 
Build and maintain structured support workflows—including ticket prioritization, escalation paths, documentation, and handoffs. 
Implement and optimize support tools (e.g., Jira, Zendesk) to track status, measure performance, and ensure visibility. 
Identify patterns and improve systems 
Analyze support trends to distinguish recurring issues from outliers; uncover root causes and recommend product or process changes. 
Maintain a backlog of systemic issues and partner with relevant teams to drive long-term resolution. 
Represent the customer internally 
Act as the voice of the customer in post-incident reviews, product discussions, and planning cycles, using insights from real support cases. 
Advocate for product reliability, usability, and supportability based on lived customer challenges. 
Deliver concise and actional executive reporting on key metrics –ticket volumes, MTTR, FRT, CSAT, customer pain-points/escalation patterns, system health 
Own SLAs, but don’t be bound by them: Do what it takes to keep our field users working, even when that means working odd hours or chasing down the right owner across time zones 


What we're looking for:

A hands-on technical leader with 5–7 years in SaaS support, solutions engineering, or technical account management, including hands-on debugging and escalation management 
Experienced in coordinating cross-functional issue resolution—you know how to get things fixed even when you don’t own the code. 
Comfortable managing the day-to-day firefighting while keeping an eye on strategic support improvements. 
Able to think analytically and act operationally—whether triaging a ticket or preparing a quarterly support trends deck. 
Excellent communicator: You tailor your message for customers, engineers, or execs—with clarity, confidence, and precision 
Tool-savvy: Comfortable using and configuring tools like Jira, Zendesk, Amplitude, Confluence, etc. 


What you'll love: 

A mission that matters—your work protects critical infrastructure and lives. 
A global team of the best and brightest across AI, product, field ops, and science. 
A seat at the table to shape how AiDASH scales its support model and customer experience. 
A fast-moving, respectful culture where outcomes speak louder than org charts


We are proud to be an equal-opportunity employer. We are committed to embracing diversity and inclusion in our hiring practices, and we promote a work environment where everyone, from any race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin, can do their best work.

We are committed to providing an inclusive and accessible interview experience for all candidates. Please let us know if you require any accommodation during the interview process, and we will make every effort to meet your needs.

Every associate is encouraged to create an individual development plan, which includes career interests and areas of strengths and development needs. Connecting their work to Gartner’s business goals helps our associates develop engagement and purpose. We see it as a core success factor that enabled over 4,700 of our associates — or over 24% of our workforce — to earn promotions in 2022.

Work-life balance
Keeping connected in a hybrid virtual-first environment We come to work each day, whether at the office or at home, to serve our clients, both internal and external, and to connect with colleagues. Gartner operates under a hybrid virtual-first working arrangement, which is perfectly suited to our digital business, as the majority of our products and services are digital. This purposeful strategy allows flexibility while fostering connection and collaboration: Most associates can work remotely the majority of the time and have the ability to use our world-class offices for team meetings, other forms of in-person collaboration and uninterrupted focus. Our approach is suited to meet the needs and expectations of a changing workforce. Moreover, it allows associates to join forces and collaborate on a global scale, eliminating the boundaries of physical distance.
