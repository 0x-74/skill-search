Work-life balance
Keeping connected in a hybrid virtual-first environment We come to work each day, whether at the office or at home, to serve our clients, both internal and external, and to connect with colleagues. Gartner operates under a hybrid virtual-first working arrangement, which is perfectly suited to our digital business, as the majority of our products and services are digital. This purposeful strategy allows flexibility while fostering connection and collaboration: Most associates can work remotely the majority of the time and have the ability to use our world-class offices for team meetings, other forms of in-person collaboration and uninterrupted focus. Our approach is suited to meet the needs and expectations of a changing workforce. Moreover, it allows associates to join forces and collaborate on a global scale, eliminating the boundaries of physical distance. To ensure that everybody remains connected, we have invested in collaboration technologies and have brought associates together through in-person team meetings, ERG learning opportunities and events and other collaboration opportunities at the office.
