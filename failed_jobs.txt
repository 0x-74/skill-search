Environmental sustainability
NVIDIA’s technological leaps in accelerated computing and generative AI are at the heart of a new industrial revolution, fundamentally reshaping industries by enhancing computing power and significantly advancing sustainability. By accelerating workloads with NVIDIA GPUs operating in parallel, we exponentially increase throughput while driving down the total energy used to complete a task and, thus, the total cost of ownership. Accelerated computing took workloads that previously required tens of thousands of general-purpose servers, consuming 10X to 20X more cost and energy and compressed it into something incredibly dense. NVIDIA’s AI technologies can transform climate research and help the world mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. In addition to powering climate and weather simulations, AI is accelerating the energy transition by making industrial-scale renewable energy more efficient and economically viable. AI can also optimize solar and wind farms, enhance power grid reliability and resilience, advance carbon capture, and power fusion breakthroughs.
